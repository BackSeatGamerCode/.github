# BackSeatGamer
Welcome to BackSeatGamer GitHub Repo. Quickly develop or search for a premade mod to allow your audience to interact with the game you are playing in real time! You distribute a link, the audience signs up, and before you know it, your audience can send custom events to your game! Most of our tools are open source, so development is even easier! 

With our custom web-based solution, you have full control over your event, and are not restricted to a streaming service! You can use this from something as complex as a Twitch or YouTube livestream, to something as simple as a Zoom/Discord call with your friends.

You even have the flexibility to create your own integration for complete control over your event. When you are finished, you can publish it so others can join the fun, or leave it as private for only yourself to use.

## How It Works
1. Download and install the mod from [BackSeatGamer](https://backseatgamer.pythonanywhere.com/)
2. Start the mod session on [BackSeatGamer](https://backseatgamer.pythonanywhere.com/)
3. Download and Run [BackSeatGamer Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/BackSeatGamerCode/ReverseProxy/releases/latest)
4. Enter the Session Auth Code in [BackSeatGamer Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/BackSeatGamerCode/ReverseProxy/releases/latest)
5. Fire up the game, and send the join link to your friends

Piece of cake!

Each time someone redeems a reward from the join link, the game will execute the reward automatically with a message explaining who redeemed the reward.

Each reward has a cooldown and a price. Viewers gain points by keeping the tab open. You have complete control of the prices and cooldowns, but the mod creator sets suggested values. You can even add/remove points from individual players to allow for even more fun.

When the event is nearing completion, why not enable frenzy mode? Frenzy mode reduces all of the prices to free, and reduces the cooldowns to the minimum defined by the mod creator. 
Warning: Frenzy mode is chaotic fun for everyone except the sucker who is getting slammed with thousands of rewards per seccond!

## Official SDKs
The following is a list of SDKs we have created to make integrating certian games even easier. Is there one missing? Feel free to open an issue, or head over to the discussions to suggest it! If you want, you can even create one yourself! Simply refer to the [BackSeatGamer Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/BackSeatGamerCode/ReverseProxy) documentation. When you are finished your SDK, let us know and we will add it to the list of Unofficial SDKs!
